Dynamic Programming :
    # Identify : 1. Choices are there
                 2. Asking optimal solution (max, min, largest...etc)

    # Recursion is the parent of DP

    # When ever choices are given, we can apply Recursion & if there is any overlapping we can apply Memoization.

    # Patterns of DP : there are generally below 10 patterns/parent problems:
        1. 0-1 KnapSack                     - 6
        2. Unbounded KnapSack               - 5
        3. Fibonacci                        - 7
        4. Longest Common Subsequence       - 15
        5. Longest Increasing Subsequence   - 10
        6. Kadane's Algorithm               - 6
        7. Matrix chain manipulation        - 7
        8. Dp on Trees                      - 4
        9. DP on grid                       - 14
        10.Others                           - 5
