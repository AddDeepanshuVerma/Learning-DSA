1. Longest increasing subsequence can be solved using
   LCS of given sequence and sorted sequence. So, it becomes a variation of knapsack only.

2.Variation of LIS :
   1. Minimum deletions to make array sorted.
   2. Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence.
   3. Maximum Biotic Subsequence.
   4. Building Bridges
   5. Longest Chain of Pairs.
