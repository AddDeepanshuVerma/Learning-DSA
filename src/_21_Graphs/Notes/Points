1. When every we are being asked that we need to move from one state string of another state string in minimal time
   THEN BFS IS THE SOLUTION.
2. If we know "the connection bw 2 nodes" OR "their is an edge bw this and this node", we can form DSU/UnionFind.
   And with DSU we can also calculate number of islands connected
3. DSU 's union function can be way compact like : parent[find(edge[1])] = find(edge[0]).

4. Check if we really need to make Adjacency lists (HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> adj) or we can work with given graph structure.
