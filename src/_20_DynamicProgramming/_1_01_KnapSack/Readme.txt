0-1 KnapSack : A wight can either be included of not (no cutting of weight or repetition of same weight)
    1. Subset sum
    2. Equal sum partition
    3. Count of subset sum
    4. Minimum subset sum difference
    5. Target sum
    6. No of subset with given diff

    Here :
    # In KnapSack we are given a knapsack with weight as W
    # A value array  : value  = {1, 3, 4, 5}
    # A weight array : weight = {1, 4, 5, 7}

    # we need to put items with such value-weight in our kanpsack that total weight of items in knapSack doesn't exceed
        its weight W, while the values of those included weights gets maximum value to us out of all possibilities.
